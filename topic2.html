    <p><font size="3">I have enjoyed this show made by Rooster Teeth.
      At first I was unsure about it, but once I watched it I found out I enjoyed it.</font></p><br>

      <div class="a">
      <p> Jaune Arc is one of my three favorite characters.
        I know there are people that hate him as a character.<br>
        He isn't like the others, he has no ranged weapon,
        he didn't unlock his semblance (power) until season five,<br>
        and he is not as good as everyone else.
        I like him because he stands out from the rest.<br>
        (R.I.P. Arkos) The image I used is from http://deathbattlefanon.wikia.com</p><br>

        <p> Another character in my three favorites is Ruby Rose.
          She is one of the main characters from the show.<br>
          She is literally the "R" in RWBY. She is another goofball character.
          She is serious when needed to be. She has<br>
           a scythe that turns into a sniper rifle.
          She has silver eyes, (a powerful ability), and she turns into rose petals. <br>
          The image used was from Twitter.</p>

        <br><p> My last of the three favorites is Qrow Branwen.
          He is a cool character that was introduced in season three.<br>
          His weapon is a large sword that turns into a scythe and a ranged weapon.
          He turns into a crow and his <br>
          sembalance is bad luck.
          He is the uncle of Ruby and her sister Yang.<br>
          He has arguements with a woman named Winter. (all us fans know what's up)<br>
